# RedBorderChromeExtension
use to debug html/css and view/learn box model

1. Download folder / git clone repo 
2. Go to chrome://extensions
3. Make sure Developer mode is (on)
4. Load unpacked (directory)

v0.0.0.1
toggle on/off (red border)

v0.0.0.2
- fixed some bugs 
- changed border to outline to keep box size the same

to do
1. add different colors (green, blue, red)
e.g. red for div outline
blue for p outline
green for article outline
2. add some better styling to the popup.

known bugs
1. unable to run on local html sites - my guess is that this is a CORS issue. As I tried other Chrome Xtns like Outline It and HTML Hierarchy Visualizer.
